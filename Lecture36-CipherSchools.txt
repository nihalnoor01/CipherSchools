The basics of algorithm were taught. An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or completing a task. In the class, we learned that an efficient algorithm is crucial because it saves time and resources.
Efficient algorithms perform better, especially with large data sets, making programs faster and more responsive. 
They also use less memory, which is important for running applications smoothly on various devices.
